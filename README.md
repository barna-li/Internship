Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.
Some Famous Algorithms: - Multiple Linear Regression, Decision tree Regression and
Gradient Boosting, Decision tree, Regression

The objective of the project clearly predicts about the insurance plan to be taken by
a person in to live a life with the better health insurance policy.
